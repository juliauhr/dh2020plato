  <h2>Explore Plato's Cave in Virtual Reality</h2>

  Escape Plato's Cave is a virtual reality game where the player solves puzzles to open new areas of the cave and eventually escape.
  A robot follows the player around, reciting passages from Plato's Republic.
  The aim is to engage students and the public in learning about philosophy in an immersive and interactive environment.
  <br><br>
  The puzzles are based on geometrical constructions.
  <br><br>
  The 3D models were made with Oculus Medium, and the game was made using A-Frame, an open-source framework for web VR.
  <br><br>
  This is a work in progress, but the code will be available on GitHub when it is finished.
